# S9: Smoothing

Spatial filtering within cord mask.

## Purpose

S9 applies spatial smoothing that respects cord boundaries.

## Algorithm

1. Cord-Masked Smoothing - Smooth only within cord
2. Anisotropic Kernel - Respect cord geometry
3. FWHM Selection - Configurable smoothing extent

*Implementation in progress*
