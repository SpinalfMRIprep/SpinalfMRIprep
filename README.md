# SpinePrep

SpinePrep is a spine fMRI/structural preprocessing and QC pipeline.

## Repo hygiene (important)

- Large datasets live in `datasets/` and are **ignored by git**.
- Runtime artifacts live in `work/` and `logs/` and are **ignored by git**.

## Development workflow (minimal)

- Create a branch per ticket: `build/S{N}-T{i}-short-desc`
- Commit messages: `BUILD-S{N}-T{i}: summary`
- Open a PR early and push often
