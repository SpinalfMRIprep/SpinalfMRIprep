# SpinePrep

SpinePrep is a spine fMRI/structural preprocessing and QC pipeline.

## Repo hygiene (important)

- Large datasets live in `datasets/` and are **ignored by git**.
- Runtime artifacts live in `work/` and `logs/` and are **ignored by git**.

## Development workflow (minimal)

- Create a branch per step: `step/S{N}-short-desc`
- Commit messages: `S{N}: summary` (optionally include ticket ids in the body)
- Open a PR early and push often
